📞 Outbound Calling Scheduler
An async, production-ready outbound SIP call scheduler built with FastAPI, LiveKit, and APScheduler. Supports concurrent multi-trunk calling, smart retry logic, CSV/XLSX bulk uploads, and live capacity monitoring.

⚙️ Installation
1. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure .env

```env
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://<your-livekit-host>
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=AP***
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=snm***
```

# Optional: comma-separated trunk IDs (defaults provided)
SIP_TRUNK_IDS=ST_xxx,ST_yyy,ST_zzz
3. Run the Scheduler
```bash
python trigger.py

```

✨ Features

🗓️ Flexible Call Scheduling

Immediate dispatch — omit scheduled_time to call right now.
Future scheduling — provide any ISO datetime to queue a call for later.
Past-time safety — if a scheduled time has already passed, the call fires immediately instead of being dropped.

⚡ Concurrent Multi-Trunk Calling

Supports multiple SIP trunks simultaneously, configurable via SIP_TRUNK_IDS in .env.
Round-robin trunk selection distributes load evenly across all trunks.
Up to 5 concurrent calls per trunk (configurable via MAX_CALLS_PER_TRUNK).
With 5 trunks × 5 slots = 25 simultaneous calls supported out of the box.
New jobs are scheduled and dispatched independently of in-progress calls — no blocking.

🔄 Intelligent Retry Logic

If a call goes unanswered or is missed, it is automatically retried after retry_delay seconds.
Retries are decremented per attempt up to max_retries — no infinite loops.
Retries are suppressed during shutdown to prevent ghost jobs on restart.
If all trunk slots are full at dispatch time, the job auto-requeues itself in 60 seconds instead of being silently dropped.

📊 Live Capacity Monitoring

GET /capacity returns a real-time snapshot:

Total active calls
Available slots
Per-trunk utilisation breakdown


GET /jobs embeds the capacity block alongside the job list for a single-call operational view.

📋 Rich Job List View
Each entry in GET /jobs includes:

id & name — job identity
next_run_utc — exact ISO timestamp of next execution
trigger — APScheduler trigger description
args — full job payload (phone, company, retries, etc.)
trunk_capacity — live active/available/per-trunk counts

📁 Bulk Scheduling via CSV / XLSX

Upload a .csv or .xlsx file to /schedule/file.
Supported columns: phone_number, job_id, trunk_id, name, scheduled_time, max_retries, retry_delay, company_name, company_id, assistant_role.
Missing optional columns are safely skipped — only phone_number is required.
Processes every valid row into independent scheduled jobs in one request.

🏠 Room & Participant Lifecycle Management

A dedicated LiveKit room is created per call with full metadata (company, agent role, contact name, etc.).
An async room monitor tracks participant count — detects when the human picks up (≥2 participants).
Room is polled for up to 1 hour to handle long calls gracefully.
Trunk slot is released automatically when the room closes, freeing capacity for the next call.

📞 Smart Phone Formatting

Strips non-digit characters, leading zeros, and country codes automatically.
Converts 12-digit numbers starting with 91 (India) to 10-digit local format compatible with Pulse SIP trunks.

🛡️ Graceful Shutdown

_shutting_down flag is set only during actual shutdown, ensuring in-flight monitors don't trigger spurious retries.
APScheduler and LiveKit client are cleanly closed on exit — no dangling tasks.

🔁 Job Management

DELETE /jobs/{job_id} — cancel any pending job by ID before it fires.
replace_existing=True — re-registering the same job_id safely updates it in place.
